# **2015 US Domestic Flights Analysis: Delays and Cancellations (Capstone 2)**

<p style='text-align: left;'> Iulia Tomescu (October, 2021)</p>

#### **General note**
>The goal of this Capstone2 project is multifold: **1)** to incorporate all the learnings (technical & analytical skills) acquired throughout the Data Analytics Career Track course offered by Springboard, **2)** to demonstrate & strengthen technical skills and computer literacy such as Python, Tableau, statistics, predictive analytics & modeling, **3)** generate a basic tutorial for people that are new to Python and Exploratory Data Analysis

#### **Acknowledgments**
>I would like to offer my thanks to my Springboard advisor Akshay Jhawar and all other mentors that gave me support throughout this project (Wayne Ang, Chris Hui, Chris Young)
