*<p style='text-align: left;'> Iulia Tomescu (October, 2021)</p>*


#### **General note**
>The goal of this Capstone2 project is multifold: **1)** to incorporate all the learnings (technical & analytical skills) acquired throughout the Data Analytics Career Track course offered by Springboard, **2)** to demonstrate & strengthen technical skills and computer literacy such as Python, Tableau, statistics, predictive analytics & modeling, **3)** generate a basic tutorial for people that are new to Python and Exploratory Data Analysis


#### **Acknowledgments**
>I would like to offer my thanks to my Springboard advisor Akshay Jhawar and all other mentors that gave me support throughout this project (Wayne Ang, Chris Hui, Chris Young)

**Why this data set**
>I chose this data set based of specific analysis targets I aimed to achieve:
>* Rich in dimensions such as categorical, numerical data, geographic data, and time series
>* Prediction potential
>* High potential business impact
>* Interesting subject

**Context**
>* The U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics tracks the on-time performance and the causes of delays and cancellation of domestic flights operated by large air carriers since 2003. Summary information on the number of on-time, delayed, canceled, and diverted flights is published in DOT's monthly Air Travel Consumer Report. It covers nonstop scheduled-service flights between points within the United States (including territories) by the fourteen (14) U.S. air carriers that have at least one percent of total domestic scheduled-service passenger revenues.
>* The current analysis focuses on the 2015 historical daily data of domestic flights operated by large air carriers, which includes specs on airlines, flights, airports, dates, time, and causes of delays and cancellations

**Goals**
>* Identify major drivers for delays and cancellations 
>* Build a model to predict overall flight delays
